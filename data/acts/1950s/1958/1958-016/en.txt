(1C) Where, in the case of any instrument
of conveyance or transfer to which section
96C does not apply and in which a pecuniary
consideration or a consideration capable of
being valued in money is set forth, it appears
to the Commissioner of Stamps that, by reason
of the fact that the consideration so expressed
seems not to have passed at the time of execu-
tion of the instrument or seems to be in-
adequate, such instrument is in reality for
the purpose of bestowing a gift, he may call
upon the parties to such instrument to furnish
proof to his satisfaction that the transaction
embodied in such instrument is a bona fid2
conveyance or transfer and not a gift. If
no such proof is furnished or the proof
furnished is in his opinion inadequate, the
Commissioner of Stamps shall deem such
instrument to be for the purpose of bestowing
a gift, and such instrument shall be charge-
able with duty accordingly.’ ;
the addition, at the end of that section, of the
following new sub-section : —

to the same person in lots by several instru-
ments, and the consideration set forth in any
such instrument does not exceed fifteen
thousand rupees, and it appears to the Com-
missioner of Stamps that several instruments
were executed with the intention of avoiding
the duty which would be chargeable if the
total area conveyed or transferred by such
instruments was conveyed or transferred by a
single instrument, he may call upon the
parties to such instruments to prove to his
satisfaction that such instruments were not
executed with such intention, and, if no such
proof is furnished or the proof furnished is,
in his opinion, inadequate, each instrument in
which the consideration set forth does net
exceed fifteen thousand rupees shall he
charged with the same rate of: duty as is
chargeable in the case of a conveyance or
transfer in which the consideration set forth
exceeds fifteen thousand rupees.”’; and

tution, for the words ‘‘ true consideration ”’,
